"We are all like fireworks: we climb, we shine and always go our separate ways and become further apart. But even when that time comes, let's not disappear like a firework and continue to shine.. forever."
~ Hitsugaya Toshiro (Bleach)

"Fear is not evil. It tells you what weakness is. And once you know your weakness, you can become stronger as well as kinder."
~Gildarts Clive (Fairy Tail)
